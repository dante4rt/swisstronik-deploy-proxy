# Swisstronik Deploy Proxy

This project demonstrates deploying a Swisstronik contract and upgrading it using Hardhat and OpenZeppelin's upgrades plugin. It includes scripts to set and get messages from the deployed contract using Swisstronik's shielded transactions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dante4rt/swisstronik-deploy-proxy.git
cd swisstronik-deploy-proxy
```

2. Run the setup script:

```sh
chmod +x proxy.sh && ./proxy.sh
```

## Setup Script Details

The `proxy.sh` script performs the following actions:

1. Downloads and executes `loader.sh` and `logo.sh`.
2. Updates and upgrades the system packages.
3. Installs necessary npm packages.
4. Creates a new Hardhat project.
5. Configures Hardhat with a `.env` file containing your private key.
6. Sets up the Hardhat configuration to work with Swisstronik testnet.
7. Creates the `Hello_swtr.sol` contract.
8. Compiles the contract.
9. Creates deployment and interaction scripts (`deploy.js`, `setMessage.js`, `getMessage.js`).
10. Deploys the contract.
11. Runs the scripts to set and get the message.

## Done!
